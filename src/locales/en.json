      "p1": "Forests, essential to life on Earth, are home to a rich biodiversity and store 40% of the Earth's carbon, playing a crucial role in the fight against climate change. However, deforestation has been accelerating since the 1970s, mainly due to agricultural expansion, leading to loss of biodiversity, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and affecting local populations. The consequences are multiple and serious: loss of biodiversity, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and impact on local populations who depend on forests for their survival. Between 2004 and 2017, 43 million hectares of forest were lost, underscoring the urgent need for action to halt this destructive process."
